# Diabetes Prediction Project

## Overview

This repository contains the code and data for a diabetes prediction project. The project includes two main components: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Model Training. The goal is to predict diabetes in individuals based on key features, such as the number of pregnancies and insulin levels.

## Key Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset and identify key features.
- Model Training using various machine learning algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier, Decision Tree, Random Forest Classifier, and Logistic Regression.
- Achieved commendable accuracy scores ranging from 75% to 90% for the prediction task.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `PimaDiabetes.csv`: Training dataset.
- `ToPredict.csv`: Testing dataset.
- `diabete_insight.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook containing the analysis code.
- `report.pdf`: A detailed report documenting the analysis process.

## Getting Started
